Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best Disposer of affairs for those who find ourselves in this situation. My little brothers and I have gone three days without food. Every hour, the landlord calls, demanding rent and threatening to throw us out to the street if we don't pay. Allah is sufficient for us, and there is no power nor strength save with Allah. O people of merciful hearts, I swear by He who raised the sky and spread out the earth that no one will be found inside our house even with a single day‚Äôs sustenance other than the neighbors to support us while we suffer pain and woes. You who love your sons and daughters, we, your daughters, are suffering and in pain, and no one looks upon us with compassion. I commend you, you who love to do good, for we are orphans and have no one, and we are threatened with being thrown out of our home and onto the street if we do not pay the rent. God is witness that we have nothing to feed our hunger. I ask you by Allah, O readers of my message, and all those who are able to, to extend a helping hand to us, even with a little money, to the best of your ability. He will not delay this opportunity for us.00967736504944 Those who want to do good, I ask Allah, O you who have helped us and stood by our side. May Allah grant him Paradise.
